      <h1>Prime or Composite</h1>
      <p>A prime number is a number which has exactly two factors i.e. ‘1’ and the number itself. A composite number has more than two factors, which means apart from getting divided by 1 and the number itself, it can also be divided by at least one positive integer. 1 is not a prime or composite number. Apart from these two, there is also a similar category of numbers which are coprime numbers.</p>
