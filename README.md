### Introduction: <br>
Basic-Web-Pages is an Open Source project that is a part of Hacktoberfest 2022. In it, you can find simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript web development projects. Our goal is to create a repository of beautifully designed simple websites that can serve as a reference for those just getting started with Web Development. Compared to other complex projects, our repository is also a great place for people to start their Open Source journey. Anyone interested in contributing to our project is welcome.
