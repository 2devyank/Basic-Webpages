             <p>A web developer is a programmer who makes websites, and apps for the World Wide Web. A web developer builds a website from the bottom up, developing everything from layout to functions and features on the page.
            <br>
             A good web developer can make almost anything happen on a website, and can build custom code to accommodate the needs of their client. Web developers have an intricate understanding of various programming languages and how they’re used.
            <br>
            A web developer might work at one organization as a permanent full-time employee, or work as an independent consultant. A web developer salary depends on what kind of work you’re involved in, your location, experience and level of seniority.</p>

                <br>
                A web developer is more concerned with functionality and features of a website, and versed in the programming languages required to create them. Web developers will still need to understand the aesthetics and art direction of the site as they implement features.
               <br>
               A web designer will create the logos, graphics, and layout that determine the look and feel of a website. Web designers will use software like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to create these materials. A web designer with a knowledge of code can help him/her better communicate with the web developer.</p>
